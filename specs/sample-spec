# This file is delivered as an example specification of register fields for the
# s command.  It specifies four 32-bit registers of a fictive CPU.  The first
# register is called "version", and it includes various fields to store the
# architecture's version and revision numbers.

# The second register is called "units".  It has twelve 1-bit fields to store
# flags that indicate the presence of CPU units u1 - u12, and an 8-bit field
# for custom units.
